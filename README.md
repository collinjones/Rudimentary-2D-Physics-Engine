# CSCI 4448 OOAD Summer 2022 Semester Project (Rudimentary 2D Physics Engine)

Authors: **Collin Jones** (cojo2657@colorado.edu), **Medhaj Shrestha** (mesh5341@colorado.edu)


## C++ Version
`g++ --version` output:
`g++ (MinGW-W64 x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh, built by Brecht Sanders) 11.2.0`



## Additional Comments

This engine is inspired by the first few chapters of a wonderful book called Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman. https://natureofcode.com/ \
Our understanding of concepts such as vectors, forces, and the concept of physics in code can be traced back to this book.  \
However, beyond that, the more complex concepts such as Elastic Collisions, Vector Reflections, Normal Vectors and Dot Product, Momentum, etc, have been interpreted from many sources such as Wikipedia, MathOverflow, StackOverflow, then pieced together to fit our particular use in a larger system. 

Collin and Medhaj have taken these concepts and represented them together at once in one large interactive simulation. 

MinGW is required to compile this code, but not sure if required to run. The DLL files are in the root folder, so those should be enough to run the .exe without any compilation. Please reach out to Collin if assistance is required.
